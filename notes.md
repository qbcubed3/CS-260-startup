## github

This is what I learned in the first assignment learning about github

The way that github works is that it allows people to collaboratively work on a project together and it handles merging the different changes that people make. This is done by commiting your changes to the central repository and then when people change the same line a warning pops up and lets you choose which change to keep. You can also fork a repository creating your own version of the repository
